# WP REST API - OAuth 2.0 Server

OAuth2 Flow for providing authorization access to WordPress REST API.

This plugin only supports WordPress >= 4.4.

## Get Involved

If you are interested in getting involved with the project, fork the repo, create a feature branch
and do a pull request when you are ready to commit. All pull requests are discussed and if approved
you will be added to the list of collaborators.

## Development

Install a fresh copy of of WordPress and clone down the repo into `/wp-contents/plugins`. You will
also need [WP API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/).

Feature branches should be prefixed with `feature` and branches that fix should be prefixed with `fix`. 
For example, a feature branch that implants WP_CLI could be named `feature-wpcli`.

## Development Guidelines

All development will follow the [WordPress coding standard](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).

* Function naming convention - All functions will need to be prefixed properly. Function prefix is `oauth2_`.
* To keep in-line with WP core ideals, functions should be broke out using wrappers if necessary. More code is drowned 
out by cleaner and more scalable code.
